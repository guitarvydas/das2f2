# d2json

- convert a diagram to JSON
- the diagram must be in .drawio format
- the diagram must follow certain syntactic conventions
  - to be documented
  - but, should be self-evident from the d2f.drawio example

This program just does a brute-force conversion from .drawio format to .json format.  For more involved transpilers, see ..


- d2f.drawio - reference only, shows how d2f.js was generated by bootstrapper
- d2f.json - reference only, shows how d2f.js was generated by bootstrapper
  - bootstrapper converted d2f.drawio -> d2f.json -> d2f.js
